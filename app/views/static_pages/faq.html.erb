              Why can't I sign into my account?
            </div>
            <p>Uh, oh. That's not good. Think of all the activity that's happening on your account while you waste your time reading this meaningless sentence when you could have just skipped to the next paragraph and figured it out by now. Ok, sorry.</p>
            <p>I'm guessing you either used the wrong email address or you forgot your password. In the second case, you need to <%= link_to "reset your password", new_student_password_path if student_signed_in? %><%= link_to "reset your password", new_instructor_password_path if instructor_signed_in? %><%= "reset your password" if !student_signed_in? && !instructor_signed_in? %>. Click the link and enter the email you that is associated with your account. Confirmation instructions will be sent to you in order to reset and change your password. Once you change your password be sure to tattoo it somewhere on your body for quick reference.</p>

              How do I delete my account?
            </div>
            <p>First of all, I'm very sad to see that you want to delete your account. Deeply saddened... alright, I'm over it.</p>
            <p>To delete your account, go to your <%= link_to "settings", edit_student_registration_path if student_signed_in? %><%= link_to "settings", edit_instructor_registration_path if instructor_signed_in? %><%= "settings" if !instructor_signed_in? && !student_signed_in?  %> and locate the delete button on the bottom of the page. Click it and you'll be prompted to delete your account. Beware, this is permanent and wipes you clean out of the database. Your courses, videos, subscriptions, nor purchases will be available. No one, not even me, can get your account back.</p>

              What are the transaction fees for Ninth Valley? 
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Right to the good stuff.</p>
              <p>Ninth Valley gets 10% of the final price to stay alive. Stripe takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for processing the payment and transfering money. In the end, instructors make a little more than 87% of the final transaction price.</p>
              <p>Here's a hypothetical situation:</p>
              <p>You've created a course and want to sell it for 50.00 USD. Awesome.</p>
              <p>A knowledge hungry student purchases your course.</p>
              <p>Ninth Valley will get 5.00 USD from that, y'know, to keep our servers running and those videos stored and flowing.</p>
              <p>Stripe takes their 1.45 USD plus 0.30 USD, a total of 1.75 USD. You don't have to worry about this part.</p>
              <p>Now, the total transaction fee is 6.75 USD, leaving 43.25 USD for you.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="padding-vertical mid-text border-bottom">
              Why do you use Stripe? 
            </div>

            <p><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> is an extremely secure way to take payments over the Internet via debit, credit, Apple Pay, or Andriod Pay. They handle everything from keeping your sensitive information secure to transfering money to our instructor's account.</p>
            <p>I believe that Stripe is better than PayPal in terms of moving money and keeping accounts secure and active. Many PayPal accounts get shut down for basically no reason (including my own) and I refuse to let that happpen to any of my instructors.</p>
            <p>We do not store your card information or any other payment information in our database at all. If Ninth Valley ever gets hacked, you do not.</p>
